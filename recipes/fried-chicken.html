    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This fried chicken features an incredibly thick and craggy crust that is heavily seasoned with a blend of eleven secret herbs and spices inspired by KFC. To ensure the meat stays juicy and tender all the way through, the chicken is soaked in a Southern buttermilk marinade. The recipe also utilizes a specific breading trick to create an ultra crunchy and nubbly exterior.</p>
    
    <p>For the <strong>ultimate</strong> homemade fast food experience, serve this chicken alongside French fries and mashed potatoes with gravy.</p>

    <h2>All the ingredients you need for that authentic KFC style fried chicken!</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: 1.5 kg (about 3 lbs) of bone-in, skin-on pieces (thighs, drumsticks, and wings work best).</li>
        <li>Buttermilk: 500ml (2 cups).</li>
        <li>Salt: 1 tablespoon.</li>
        <li>Egg: 1 large egg (whisked into the marinade to help the flour stick).</li>
    </ul>



    <h2>The Breading (KFC Copycat Mix)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Base: 2 cups all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup cornstarch (cornstarch is the secret to extra crunch).</li>
        <li>2/3 tablespoon of salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon of dried thyme</li> 
        <li>1/2 tablespoon of dried basil</li>
        <li>1/3 tablespoon of dried oregano</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon of celery salt</li> 
        <li>1 tablespoon of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of dried mustard</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of paprika</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons of garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ground ginger</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons pf ground white pepper</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The method.</h2>

    <p>
  Begin by whisking the <strong>buttermilk, egg, and salt</strong> together in a large bowl. Submerge your chicken pieces in the mixture, cover, and refrigerate for at least <strong>four hours</strong>, though overnight is ideal for the best results. This step tenderizes the meat and ensures it stays juicy during the high-heat frying process.
</p>

<p>
  In a large shallow dish, whisk together the <strong>flour, cornstarch, and all eleven herbs and spices</strong> until the color is uniform. To achieve the secret nubbly texture, drizzle two to three tablespoons of the <strong>buttermilk marinade</strong> into the dry flour mix. Use your fingers to rub the liquid into the flour until <strong>small clumps form</strong> throughout the breading, as these clumps create the craggy and ultra-crunchy crust.
</p>

<p>
  Remove a piece of chicken from the marinade and let the excess liquid drip off before placing it into the flour mixture. <strong>Press down firmly</strong> so the flour and the small clumps adhere to the surface, ensuring every nook and cranny is heavily coated. Place the breaded chicken on a <strong>wire rack</strong> and let it rest for about fifteen minutes to help the coating set so it does not fall off in the oil.
</p>

<p>
  Heat a large pot with about three inches of neutral oil to <strong>175°C</strong>. Carefully lower the chicken into the oil in batches to avoid overcrowding and fry for <strong>twelve to fifteen minutes</strong> while turning occasionally. Once the crust is deep golden brown and the internal temperature reaches <strong>74°C</strong>, remove the pieces and let them rest on a clean wire rack for five minutes before serving to keep the bottom from getting soggy.
