    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that makes this steak melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! Trust me, after you make this steak you will wonder why you ever even bothered to go out for one!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sirloin steak...obviously!</li>
        <li>1/2 of a cup of butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic.</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Method.</h2>

<p>
  Start by gathering all your ingredients and preheating your oven to 200°C (180°C fan/gas mark 6), or if you prefer a traditional finish, heat a heavy-based griddle pan or skillet on the hob over a high heat. While the appliance heats up, melt your butter in a small saucepan over a medium-low heat.
</p>

<p>
  Stir the diced garlic and garlic powder into the melted butter. Once combined, move the pan off the hob and set it aside to let the flavours meld while you prepare the meat.
</p>

<p>
  Take your sirloin steaks and season both sides of each piece generously with salt and pepper. For the best sear, ensure the steaks have been taken out of the fridge ahead of time to reach room temperature before they start cooking.
</p>

<p>
  Place the steaks into the hot pan on the hob or onto a tray in the oven. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes per side if using the hob, or adjust based on your oven's efficiency. If you are using an instant-read thermometer, aim for an internal temperature of 60°C in the centre for a perfect medium doneness.
</p>

<p>
  Transfer the steaks to warmed plates and brush the tops liberally with the garlic butter. Allow the meat to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving to ensure the steaks remain juicy and tender.
