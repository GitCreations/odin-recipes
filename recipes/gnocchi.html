    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Certain to be a family favorite, this creamy gnocchi sauce recipe is a fusion of rich mascarpone, fragrant shallot, and robust garlic cloves, simmered together with heavy cream, cheese, and pillowy gnocchi for a quick and easy meal.</p>

    <h2>What the hell is Gnocchi?</h2>
    <p>Gnocchi are a type of Italian dumpling most commonly made from boiled potatoes, flour, and eggs. The mixture is rolled into long ropes, cut into bite-sized nuggets, and often pressed against a fork or a wooden board to create ridges that catch the sauce. Once boiled, they develop a soft, "pillowy" texture that is denser than pasta but lighter than a traditional bread dumpling. While potato is the standard base, they are also frequently made with ricotta cheese (known as gnudi) or semolina flour.</p>
