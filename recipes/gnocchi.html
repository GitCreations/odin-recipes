    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Certain to be a family favorite, this creamy gnocchi sauce recipe is a fusion of rich mascarpone, fragrant shallot, and robust garlic cloves, simmered together with heavy cream, cheese, and pillowy gnocchi for a quick and easy meal.</p>

    <h2>What the hell is Gnocchi?</h2>
    <p>Gnocchi are a type of Italian dumpling most commonly made from boiled potatoes, flour, and eggs. The mixture is rolled into long ropes, cut into bite-sized nuggets, and often pressed against a fork or a wooden board to create ridges that catch the sauce. Once boiled, they develop a soft, "pillowy" texture that is denser than pasta but lighter than a traditional bread dumpling. While potato is the standard base, they are also frequently made with ricotta cheese (known as gnudi) or semolina flour.</p>
    
    <h2>Now for the fun part... the ingredients!</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Butter (or olive oil)
        <li>Garlic (fresh cloves or powder)</li>
        <li>Shallot (posh onion)</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Mascarpone</li>
        <li>Shredded Gruyere</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>Salt (preferably sea salt)</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Gnocchi (homemade or store-bought)</li>

    


    </ul>

    <h2>How to make creamy Gnocchi sauce?</h2>
    
    <p>Start by boiling a large pot of salted water. While that heats up, melt some butter in a big skillet over medium heat and sauté your diced shallots for about three minutes. Once they’re soft, stir in the garlic for a minute until it smells great—just be careful not to let the butter or garlic burn, as the flavor turns bitter quickly.</p>

    <p>Next, slowly whisk the heavy cream into the skillet, then stir in the mascarpone until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Season it with a bit of salt and pepper, turn the heat down to low, and let it simmer for a few minutes. Take the pan off the heat and whisk in your Gruyère and Parmesan until the cheese is completely melted. Give it a quick taste to see if it needs more salt or pepper.</p>

    <p>Finally, drop the gnocchi into your boiling water. As soon as they float to the top, use a slotted spoon to move them straight from the water into the sauce. Give everything a good toss to coat the gnocchi evenly, then serve it right away with an extra sprinkle of Parmesan and black pepper on top. Enjoy!</p>
